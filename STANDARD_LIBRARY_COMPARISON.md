# Nen-Net vs Zig Standard Library Comparison

## Overview

This document compares `nen-net` (our statically allocated HTTP/TCP framework) with Zig's built-in standard library networking capabilities.

## Architecture Comparison

### Nen-Net Architecture
- **Static Memory Allocation**: Zero dynamic allocation, predictable memory usage
- **Inline Functions**: Critical operations marked `inline` for performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Pre-allocated connection pools
- **Unified API**: Single library with HTTP, TCP, WebSocket, and performance monitoring
- **Performance Targets**: 100K concurrent connections, 1M req/s, <1ms latency

### Standard Library Architecture
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Uses dynamic memory allocation for buffers and data structures
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for different protocols (`std.http`, `std.net`, etc.)
- **Low-level Abstractions**: Provides building blocks rather than high-level frameworks
- **Platform Abstraction**: Cross-platform networking abstractions

## Feature Comparison

### HTTP Server

| Feature | Nen-Net | Standard Library |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Server Type** | High-level, unified API | Low-level, connection-based |
| **Memory Management** | Static allocation | Dynamic allocation |
| **Connection Handling** | Connection pooling | Manual connection management |
| **Request Processing** | Route-based with handlers | Manual request parsing |
| **Performance Monitoring** | Built-in | None |
| **Configuration** | Structured config objects | Manual setup |

**Nen-Net Example:**
```zig
var server = try nen_net.createHttpServer(8080);
try server.addRoute("GET", "/api/users", userHandler);
```

**Standard Library Example:**
```zig
var server = net.Server.init(.{});
var connection = try server.accept();
var http_server = http.Server.init(connection, read_buffer);
var request = try http_server.receiveHead();
```

### TCP Framework

| Feature | Nen-Net | Standard Library |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Client/Server** | High-level abstractions | Low-level socket operations |
| **Buffer Management** | Pre-allocated buffers | Manual buffer management |
| **Connection Lifecycle** | Managed | Manual |
| **Error Handling** | Custom error types | System-level errors |
| **Performance** | Optimized for high throughput | Generic implementation |

**Nen-Net Example:**
```zig
var client = try nen_net.createTcpClient("localhost", 8080);
try client.send("Hello, World!");
```

**Standard Library Example:**
```zig
var stream = try net.tcpConnectToAddress(address);
try stream.writeAll("Hello, World!");
```

### WebSocket Support

| Feature | Nen-Net | Standard Library |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Implementation** | Planned high-level API | Low-level WebSocket handling |
| **Frame Management** | Planned | Manual frame parsing |
| **Protocol Handling** | Planned | Basic protocol support |
| **Integration** | Unified with HTTP/TCP | Separate module |

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage

**Nen-Net:**
- Fixed memory footprint
- No allocation overhead during operation
- Predictable memory usage patterns
- Connection pools pre-allocated

**Standard Library:**
- Variable memory usage
- Allocation overhead during operation
- Memory usage depends on request size
- Dynamic buffer allocation

### Throughput

**Nen-Net Targets:**
- 1M requests/second
- 100K concurrent connections
- <1ms latency
- <5% memory overhead

**Standard Library:**
- Performance varies by implementation
- No specific performance guarantees
- Depends on manual optimization
- Memory overhead varies

## Use Case Analysis

### When to Use Nen-Net

✅ **Best For:**
- High-performance applications requiring predictable performance
- Embedded systems with memory constraints
- Real-time applications needing low latency
- Applications requiring connection pooling
- Projects needing unified networking API
- Performance-critical applications

### When to Use Standard Library

✅ **Best For:**
- Learning and prototyping
- Simple networking needs
- Custom protocol implementations
- Low-level control requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Integration with existing code

## Code Complexity Comparison

### Nen-Net (High-Level)
```zig
// Simple HTTP server setup
var server = try nen_net.quickServer(8080, &[_]nen_net.Route{
    .{ .method = "GET", .path = "/", .handler = homeHandler },
    .{ .method = "POST", .path = "/api", .handler = apiHandler },
});

// Start server
try server.start();
```

### Standard Library (Low-Level)
```zig
// Manual server setup
var server = net.Server.init(.{});
defer server.deinit();

while (true) {
    var connection = try server.accept();
    var http_server = http.Server.init(connection, read_buffer);
    
    var request = try http_server.receiveHead();
    // Manual request handling...
    
    var response = try http_server.respond();
    // Manual response building...
}
```

## Migration Path

### From Standard Library to Nen-Net

1. **Replace low-level constructs** with high-level APIs
2. **Convert manual buffer management** to configuration-based approach
3. **Replace manual connection handling** with connection pooling
4. **Add performance monitoring** using built-in tools

### From Nen-Net to Standard Library

1. **Replace high-level APIs** with low-level socket operations
2. **Implement manual memory management** for buffers
3. **Add manual connection lifecycle management**
4. **Implement custom performance monitoring**

## Conclusion

**Nen-Net** provides a high-level, performance-optimized networking framework with static memory allocation, while **Zig's standard library** offers low-level building blocks for custom networking implementations.

- **Choose Nen-Net** for production applications requiring high performance, predictable memory usage, and rapid development
- **Choose Standard Library** for learning, prototyping, or when you need low-level control over networking behavior

The frameworks complement each other - Nen-Net builds upon standard library concepts while providing higher-level abstractions and performance optimizations.
